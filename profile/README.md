## Digital Lagniappe

Digital Lagniappe is a software development and technology consulting firm specializing in software development, website development, and custom computers.

### Lagniappe

In the south (especially Louisiana), lagniappe means "a small gift given to a customer" or more simply “a little something extra”. 
In business schools across the world, students are taught that businesses should strive to meet or exceed the expectations of their 
customers. At Digital Lagniappe, we never want to just meet your expectations. We start every project with the purpose of exceeding 
your expectations. In other words, it’s our goal to always leave you with “a little something extra”.

### History

Originally founded by 3 friends during their time at Nicholls State University as a computer repair company. It was then run 
by 1 of the original founders and changed to focus on custom software and web development. Hardware had been 
cut back but custom computers were still built occasionally. It is now just a tag-line for that founder.
